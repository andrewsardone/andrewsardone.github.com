title: a2div CouchApps Presentation
---

I gave a talk at [a2div](http://a2div.com/) this evening on [CouchDB](http://couchdb.apache.org/) and [CouchApps](http://couchapp). a2div is a great group that has hosted a lot of neat talks, so I thought I'd try to contribute.

I attempted to record the presentation but the audio did not work (so no video link, darn). Here are the [slides](/presentations/20110224.a2div_couchapps.pdf) though if anyone is interested.
