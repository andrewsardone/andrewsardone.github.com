title: Brief Google Wave Review
---

I wanted to put this on record somewhere so I can either be vindicated or shown to be a fool sometime in the future. Briefly, I just don't get Google Wave. The interface is confusing and cluttered. It's unclear where my focus should be in the application. It's already been noted the [awkward nature of seeing chat text typed in real time](http://www.slate.com/id/2232311/pagenum/all), noting it just adds more noise. Google Wave seems to fall short of helping real time, rich collaboration.

Though I'm not writing it off yet. I still haven't played with Google Wave extensively, nor have I used it in a real world context. Simply put, I failed to immediately grasp a wave's power.
