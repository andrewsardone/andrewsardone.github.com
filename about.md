================

My name is Andrew. I'm a technology professional focused mainly on software development and transforming complexity into simplicity. I've historically been a poor writer, so I plan on using this medium to hone the skill by showcasing my work and interests ranging from all things tech to music, humor, and whatever I find interesting.

I live in [Ann Arbor, MI](http://annarbor.com) and attended the [University of Michigan](http://umich.edu) where I studied [math](http://www.math.lsa.umich.edu/). Find me on the web at the links on the side.
