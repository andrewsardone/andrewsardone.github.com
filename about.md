My name is Andrew. I'm a technology professional focused mainly on software development. I've historically been a poor writer, so I plan on using this medium to hone the skill, showcasing my work and interests.

I can't, however, promise to regularly put new content on here. For the time being, this might just be a glorified landing page.

![me](/images/me.png "Andrew Sardone")

I live in [Ann Arbor](http://annarbor.com) and attended the [University of Michigan](http://umich.edu) where I studied [math](http://www.math.lsa.umich.edu/). Find me on the web via the links in the header, check out my [résumé](andrew.sardone.resume.txt), or email me at <a href="mailto:andrew.sardone@gmail.com">andrew.sardone@gmail.com</a>.
